# Instructions

Feel free to post your ideas for TODOs here. If it seems more like a bug in the existing code, post it to [[bugs]] instead. Useful commands that can be put inside the TODOs: 

[[!template id=note text="By default, TODOs that don't have a priority tag are classified as [[priority/low]]."]]

- Link items to [[todo/done]] when done by inserting \[[done]] 
- Link items to appropriate [[owner]] when assigning a todo by inserting, for example, \[[!tag owner/arlolra]] 
- Link items to appropriate priority levels ([[priority/high]], [[priority/medium]], [[priority/low]]) by inserting, for example, \[[!tag priority/medium]]

There are 
[[!pagecount pages="todo/* and !todo/owner/* and !todo/priority/* and !todo/done and !link(todo/done)"]] 
TODOs that are not done, of which 
[[!pagecount pages="todo/* and !todo/owner/* and !todo/priority/* and !todo/done and !link(todo/done) and !link(owner/*)"]] 
haven't been assigned to anyone yet.
